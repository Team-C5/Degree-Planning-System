# Degree-Planning-System
The Degree Planning system is a simple and fast program that could be extended and used by real schools. It allows a user to check four different reports such as a table with all students with declared major and transcript of courses taken, courses offered by the college, a degree plan for each of the declarable majors, and a semester schedule of classes offered. The program is accessible to anyone on any platform and on any device to ensure maximum usage.
